The Assignment

We would like to see what you can build with the data
provided. Feel free to present the results in any
format you prefer and explore any additional ideas you
have with the dataset. You may use any model or
architecture of your choice. The goal is to
demonstrate your knowledge and experience. We are
particularly interested in the logic and reasoning
behind your choice of accuracy metrics and your
ability to communicate your solutions and ideas
effectively.

We’d like you to please demonstrate a LLM driven
prototype that can answer questions based on financial
documents (texts, tables, figures etc.).

The dataset we'd like you to use is the train.json in
the ConvFinQA dataset.

Here is a snippet of the json which contains the
question, as well as the correct answer that your
solution should aim to produce:
qa": {
"question": "what was the percentage
change in the net cash from operating activities
from 2008 to 2009”,
"answer": "14.1%",
}

Please produce a report on metrics with the accuracies
of your system, and a short write-up of your findings
and shortcomings.
